This is a project to create a quiz which will hopefully have some replay value for English language students. 

The idea is to provide a comprehensive list of grammatical questions which are appropriate for learners of the English language.
The quiz is particularly aimed at those of an intermediate level of learning.
Materials are taken from Common European Framework of Reference, with reference to competencies which are appropriate for an intermediate learner.
